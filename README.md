### good developer mindset:

*the purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are
Every programmer is a designer.
Developers who donâ€™t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems.
Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development*
